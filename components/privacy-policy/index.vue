          At PT Rajawali Putra Logistik, we value your trust and are committed
          to protecting the privacy of all users who interact with our services.
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect
          your personal information when you visit our website, use our
          logistics services, or communicate with us through any channel. When
          you use our services—such as booking a shipment or submitting a
          delivery request—we may collect certain personal information from you.
          This may include your name, phone number, email address, ID number,
          and complete pickup and delivery addresses. We also gather
          package-related details necessary for logistics processing. In some
          cases, we may collect billing or payment details, especially if
          services are paid electronically. Additionally, when you visit our
          website, we may automatically collect technical data such as your IP
          address, device type, browser version, and usage patterns to help us
          improve our site performance and user experience. Your personal data
          is used for purposes that include processing shipments, tracking
          deliveries, managing customer inquiries, and improving our overall
          service quality. We may also use your information to send
          service-related notifications or updates about your delivery status.
          In some cases, we may use your information to prevent fraud, ensure
          security, comply with legal requirements, or conduct internal analysis
          to improve our operational efficiency. We are committed to handling
          your data responsibly. Your personal information may be shared with
          trusted third-party partners who support our logistics operations,
          such as delivery agents, IT service providers, or payment gateways.
          However, we do not sell, rent, or share your information with third
          parties for marketing purposes. Any data sharing is done solely for
          service fulfillment and is protected by agreements that ensure
          confidentiality and compliance with applicable laws, including
          Indonesia’s Personal Data Protection Law (UU PDP). All personal data
          is stored securely and only for as long as necessary to fulfill the
          purposes for which it was collected. Once your data is no longer
          needed or upon request, we will delete or anonymize it, in accordance
          with legal and operational requirements. We implement strong security
          measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, loss, or
          misuse, including access controls and encryption where necessary. By
          using our website or engaging with our services, you consent to the
          collection and use of your personal information as outlined in this
          Privacy Policy. You also have rights to access, correct, or request
          deletion of your data, and to withdraw your consent at any time,
          unless legal obligations prevent us from doing so. If you have any
          questions or concerns about how we handle your personal data, or if
          you would like to exercise your rights, please don’t hesitate to
          contact us. You can reach PT Rajawali Putra Logistik via email at
          [Insert Email Address], or by phone at [Insert Phone Number]. Our
          customer service team is available to assist you with any data-related
          inquiries or requests.
